# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not open public issues for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, report privately to repository maintainers with:

- vulnerability summary
- impact
- reproduction steps
- suggested remediation (if available)

## Response Process

- We will acknowledge receipt.
- We will reproduce and assess severity.
- We will ship a fix and publish coordinated notes when appropriate.

## Scope

This app handles local credentials and session artifacts. Reports related to credential leakage, insecure storage, auth bypass, and unsafe logging are in scope.

Do not include real cookies/tokens in reports.
